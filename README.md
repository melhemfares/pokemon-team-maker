# Pokemon Team Maker

My Grade 12 Computer Science (ICS4U1) ISU. A project created in Java using Terminal I/O that allows the user to create a Pokemon team and moves for each Pokemon.

## ðŸš€ About Me
I am a Grade 12 student at Chaminade College School, soon to be Computer Science major at York University.


## Lessons Learned

This project mainly taught me how to implement OOP in Java. I also learned about the Comparator class which allowed me to easily sort the Pokemon array.
